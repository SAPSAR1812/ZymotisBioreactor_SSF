# ZymotisBioreactor_SSF

Guide: Dr T Renganathan

This project aims to model a solid state fermentation reaction in a Zymotis Bioreactor. This slightly incomplete PPT (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WJ7lRv6tTbM24UtteMjPC6XzHpUT8Wp0cyq-AOXofek/edit?usp=sharing) contains general information of the process and the heat transfer but it gives a good general overview of the problem. For accurate plots, please go to the respective directories.
