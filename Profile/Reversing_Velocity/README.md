Several papers tested the concept of reversing aeration rate at regular intervals to decrease overheating. The frequency of aeration rate depends on rate of temperature
increase. For this problem, a reversal rate of every 80 time units was deemed appropriate. 

The results from the simulation indicate that aeration reversal isn't an effective way to decrease overheating. Conversion at the midpoint shows a much better 
t99 time compared to the one with aeration rate. The reversal of aeration doesn't remove heat; it simply distributes heat from one end to the other. Conversion at
the ends is better than standard non-reversal ends, but overall, it doesn't have a net positive effect.
