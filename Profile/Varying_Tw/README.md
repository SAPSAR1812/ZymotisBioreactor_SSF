Three cases:

1) Tw=15
2) Tw=25
3) Tw=35

Although case 1 decreases the average temperature of the reactor, it doesn't allow the reaction to take place at optimal temperature of 38C for as much time as that 
Tw=25. Tw=25C emerges as the optimal case based on time taken to reach 99% conversion rate. 

Tw=15 > 40785
Tw=25 > 40577
Tw=35 > 40890 

313 time units isn't a large difference, a cost analysis would be the way to go to find optimal temperature of cooling water.
